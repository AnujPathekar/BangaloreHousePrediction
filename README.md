  - **society**: Contains information about the housing society associated with the property.
  - **total_sqft**: Denotes the total square footage area of the property.
  - **bath**: Indicates the number of bathrooms in the property.
  - **balcony**: Represents the number of balconies in the property.
  - **price**: Specifies the price of the property.

- **Data Types**:
  - The DataFrame contains columns with both numeric and object data types.
  - Numeric columns: `bath` and `price`.
  - Object columns: `location`, `size`, and `total_sqft`.

- **Missing Values**:
  - The `location` column has one missing value.
  - The `size` column has 16 missing values.
  - The `bath` column has 73 missing values.
  - The `balcony` column has 609 missing values.
  - There are no missing values in the `area_type`, `availability`, `society`, `total_sqft`, and `price` columns.

- **Memory Usage**:
  - The DataFrame consumes approximately 520.4 KB of memory.


## <u>**Data Pre-Processing**</u>

In the data pre-processing phase, we performed several steps to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. Here's an overview of the steps taken:

- **DataFrame Information**:
  - We initially examined the dataset using the `df.info()` function, which provided insights into the number of rows, columns, and data types.
  - The DataFrame contains a total of 13,320 entries and 5 columns.

- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - We identified columns with missing values:
    - `location`: 1 missing value
    - `size`: 16 missing values
    - `bath`: 73 missing values
  - We addressed these missing values as follows:
    - For the `location` column, we filled the missing value with 'Sarjapur Road'.
    - For the `size` column, we filled the missing values with '2 BHK'.
    - For the `bath` column, we filled the missing values with the mean value of the column.

- **Data Type Conversion**:
  - We converted the `size` column from an object type (e.g., '2 BHK') to an integer type (e.g., 2) by extracting the numeric part.

- **Total Square Footage Conversion**:
  - We applied a custom function `convertRange` to the `total_sqft` column to handle variations in square footage representations (e.g., '1000 - 1200' sqft). The function converted such ranges to their average values.

- **DataFrame Summary**:
  - We used `df.describe()` to obtain summary statistics for numerical columns (`bath` and `price`). This provided insights into the central tendency, dispersion, and range of the data.
  - The `bath` column, for example, had a mean of approximately 2.69 and a maximum value of 40.

## <u>Handling Outliers</u>

In the process of data preprocessing and outlier handling, several steps were taken to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.

- **Price Per Square Foot (PPSF) Calculation**: A new feature, PPSF, was introduced to the dataset. It represents the price per square foot of each property, calculated as the ratio of the price to the total square footage. This metric can help identify outliers based on unusually high or low PPSF values.

- **Initial Summary Statistics**: To understand the data's distribution and spot outliers, summary statistics were generated for key numeric columns, including size, total square footage, number of bathrooms, price, and PPSF.

- **Location Counts**: An analysis of the 'location' column was conducted to identify locations with very few property listings. These locations were categorized as 'other' to reduce the granularity of the dataset.

- **Outliers Removal**: The removal of outliers was primarily focused on the 'total_sqft' feature relative to the 'size' of the property. Properties with a total square footage per bedroom below 300 square feet were considered outliers and subsequently removed from the dataset.

- **Final Dataset**: After removing outliers and processing the data, the dataset was left with 12,530 rows and five columns, including 'location', 'size', 'total_sqft', 'bath', and 'price'.

By calculating the price per square foot and addressing outliers, the dataset was refined to improve the accuracy and reliability of future analyses and machine learning models.

**Summary**:

- Calculated the Price Per Square Foot (PPSF) to identify potential outliers.
- Generated summary statistics for key numeric columns.
- Categorized locations with minimal property listings as 'other'.
- Removed outliers based on low total square footage per bedroom (below 300 square feet).
- Resulted in a final dataset with 12,530 rows and five essential columns.
- Outliers were handled to enhance the dataset's quality for future analysis and modeling.


## <u>Model Building</u>

In this phase of the project, we constructed and evaluated machine learning models for predicting property prices based on the provided dataset. Here's an overview of the key steps and results:

- **Data Splitting**: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. This ensured that the model is trained on one subset of the data and evaluated on another to assess its generalization performance.
  - Training Data (X_train, Y_train):
    - Features (X_train): 10,024 rows and 4 columns.
    - Target Variable (Y_train): 10,024 rows.

- **Feature Transformation**: To preprocess the features, a column transformer was employed. Categorical data in the 'location' column was one-hot encoded, while other numerical features were retained as-is.

- **Standard Scaling**: Standardization was applied to ensure that all features had a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This process helps models that rely on gradient descent converge faster.

**Linear Regression**
- A linear regression model was constructed using the `LinearRegression` class from scikit-learn. This model aims to establish a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

**Lasso Regression**
- Lasso regression, implemented using the `Lasso` class, was utilized to introduce L1 regularization. It helps prevent overfitting and can lead to feature selection by driving some feature coefficients to zero.

**Ridge Regression**
- Ridge regression, implemented with the `Ridge` class, introduced L2 regularization. Like Lasso, it helps mitigate overfitting by penalizing large coefficients but uses a different regularization technique.

- **Model Evaluation**: The models' performance was assessed using the R-squared (R2) metric, which measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features. The higher the R2 score, the better the model's predictive capability.

**R-squared Scores**:
- Linear Regression R2 Score: 40.82%
- Lasso Regression R2 Score: 41.22%
- Ridge Regression R2 Score: 40.83%

These R2 scores provide insights into how well the models fit the data. Lasso regression slightly outperformed the other models in this initial evaluation.

**Summary in Bullet Points**:
- Data was split into training and testing sets.
- Features were preprocessed with one-hot encoding and standard scaling.
- Linear regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression models were built and evaluated.
- R2 scores were used to assess model performance.
- Lasso regression demonstrated the highest R2 score among the models, indicating its effectiveness in predicting property prices.

These models provide a starting point for predicting property prices, and further optimization and fine-tuning can be explored to improve predictive accuracy.

7. **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to obtain more robust estimates of model performance. This can help assess how well the models generalize to unseen data.

8. **Advanced Regression Models**: Explore more advanced regression models, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) or ElasticNet, to see if they can provide better predictive performance.

9. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Conduct feature importance analysis to understand which features have the most significant impact on property prices. This can guide feature selection and engineering efforts.

10. **Data Augmentation**: Consider augmenting the dataset with additional relevant data sources, if available. More data can potentially improve model accuracy.

11. **Time-Series Analysis**: If the dataset contains temporal information, consider incorporating time-series analysis techniques to capture seasonality and trends in property prices.

12. **Model Interpretability**: Focus on improving model interpretability to gain insights into the factors that influence property prices. Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) can help explain model predictions.

13. **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Collaborate with domain experts or real estate professionals to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the modeling process. Their insights can lead to more accurate predictions.

14. **Deployment and Monitoring**: Once a satisfactory model is developed, consider deploying it in a real-world environment. Implement monitoring to ensure that the model's predictions remain accurate over time.

15. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with the latest advancements in machine learning and regression techniques. Continuously refine and adapt the model as new data becomes available and as the problem evolves.

By addressing these future aspects, you can work towards building a more robust and accurate model for predicting property prices in Bangalore.
